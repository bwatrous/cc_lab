# CycleCloud Training Labs
* Microsoft Specialized Compute (HPC) Team - <mailto:askcyclecloud @ microsoft.com>
* Initial versions by Ben Watrous, January 2018

## Overview

These labs provide a quick introduction to building and deploying CycleCloud Projects and Clusters.

The labs should be completed in the following order:

1. filer : Shows how to create a standalone NFS filesystem cluster in CycleCloud.
2. gromacs : (Depends on filer...) Shows how to create an application using [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/About_Gromacs) as an example.

The gromacs lab uses the included `nvidia` project to install the required GPU drivers on the cluster nodes.

## Pre-Requisites

These labs assume that you have completed the [CycleCloud Labs](https://github.com/azurebigcompute/Labs/tree/master/CycleCloud%20Labs) lab and have a fully configured CycleCloud instance.
